# moodle-local_lesson_wordimport
This plugin extends the core Lesson to support importing lessons from a Word file
where the pages are stored in structured headings with bookmarks to link them.


## Installation

General plugin installation instructions are available at
http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Installing_plugins

### Upgrading from an older to a newer version

The plugin does not store any plugin specific data in the
Moodle database. This means that you do not lose any data if you
uninstall it, and you can upgrade to another version of the
plugin simply by uninstalling the old version and then
installing the new version.
